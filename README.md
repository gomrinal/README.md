👋 Hey There, I'm Mrinal and I am product focussed Data Scientist/MLE. I like to solve problems collaboratively in an inclusive and empathic environment.
<br>
<br>
⭐ I adore and value emotional quotient in people and place strong emphasis on mentoring Juniors as I grow within my role.
<br>
<br>
⭐ Lastly, I enjoy taking parts in Hackathon. My this year goal is to attend ML conference and next year's is to present something to ML/Data Science community.
<br>
<br>
⭐ When I'm not at my desk. I prefer hiking in the woods or camping 🏕️ with my friends with a nice bon fire 🔥 
<br>
<br>
⭐ Fun fact: I've hiked 35 km with 250 ml of Gatorade. Lowkey, I feel I should be a paid ambassador of Gatorade 🥇
